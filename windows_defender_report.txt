-->Project Title
Windows Defender Security & Malware Protection System

-->Student Details
Name: Malleswari P
Course: Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA)
Project Type: IT Support 
Date: November 2025

-->Objective
To demonstrate how Windows Defender protects a computer from viruses, malware, and ransomware by performing different types of scans, checking protection history, and using PowerShell commands for automation.

-->Tools & Technologies Used

Windows Defender (built-in antivirus in Windows 11)
PowerShell (for scan automation)
Microsoft Excel (for maintaining scan logs)
Notepad (for documentation)

-->Procedure
Step 1 — Verify Protection Status
Opened Windows Security → Virus & threat protection
→ Ensured Real-time protection is ON.
→ Took a screenshot of the Defender dashboard.

Step 2 — Performed Different Scans
Executed Quick Scan, Full Scan, and Customised Scan from the Windows Security app.
Observed duration and results for each scan.

Step 3 — Checked Protection History
Viewed Protection History to check if any threats were found and what actions were taken (quarantine, removal, etc.).

Step 4 — Used PowerShell Commands

Used PowerShell to automate and check Defender status:
Get-MpComputerStatus
Start-MpScan -ScanType QuickScan

Step 5 — Enabled Ransomware Protection
Enabled Controlled Folder Access under Ransomware protection to safeguard important folders (e.g., Documents).

Step 6 — Documented Results
Created a scan log and included screenshots of all steps in the report.

-->Results
Windows Defender successfully detected and quarantined threats.
All other scans showed the system was safe.
Controlled Folder Access prevented unauthorized access to files.
PowerShell commands helped in automating and verifying system protection.

-->Conclusion
This project demonstrated how Windows Defender protects a Windows system through multiple layers of defense.
By performing scans, checking protection history, and using PowerShell automation, this project helped understand endpoint security, malware protection, and IT support tasks effectively.
